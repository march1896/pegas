/* 
 * the problem of open interval VS closed interval.
 * for a pair of iterators (begin, end), what the interval it represent?
 * generally, there are to kinds.
 * [begin, end) (half opened interval, which is used in C++ STL)
 * [begin, end] (closed interval, which is easier to implement, I think)
 *
 * I used to think this is only a style problem, you can choose any of them 
 * obey it all the way.
 *
 * So what happened when acquire a begin/end iterator for an empty container?
 * The iterator is not well defined. 
 * [begin, end) style seems solved this problem. end, as a sentinel, works well.
 *
 * But this half opened interval also has its own drawbacks.
 * It assumes that the algorithm will traverse from begin, and finally walks to end.
