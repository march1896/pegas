/* Heap block definitions */
/* design requirements for struct block:
 *
 * when the block is allocated, it is not in the free list, we should know:
 *    1, the previous/next adjacent block. (when it is given back to the heap
 *       it should know the prevIous/next block address to do the merge work).
 *
 * when the block is not allocated, it is in the free list, we should know:
 *    1, the size of the block. (in order to decide if it's allocatable by a given size)
 *    2, the previous/next free block. (to maintain the free list)
 *    3, the next adjacent block,(it is a little hard to understand this 
 *       rule, consider the current block is in free list, and the prev/next 
 *       adjacent blocks are both allocated, and now the prev adjacent freed and 
 *       combined with the current block, now the next block is still allocated,
 *       so it should know the previous adjacent block, which will be changed 
 *       after the combination, so we should notify the next adjacent block that
 *       its prev is changed, the prev adjacent block is no need to know since its 
 *       next pointer will never changed if it's allocated), this rule is duplicated
 *       with rule 1 since if we know the address and size of a block, we will 
 *       certainly know the next adjacent block.
 *    4, the previous adjacent block( this is the hardest part to understand, I
 *       was unsuccessfully design the data structure, because I thought this member
 *       is not useful for in_freelist blocks. Indeed, when maintaining the free list,
 *       prev_adj is not need to known. But when we allocate a free block from free list,
 *       the block comes to allocated immediately, in other words, we must know the 
 *       prev_adj/next_adj immediately. I spent a lot of time to define data structure 
 *       and algorithm based on the absent of prev_adj for in_freelist block, until 
 *       I am starting to write allocate(), what a pity.
 *
 *  at any time, when a get a pointer of a block, we could tell if the block is in
 *    free list. (this is also related for merging work, when we try to merge 
 *    the current block with prev/next adjacent block, we should first prev/next 
 *    adjacent blocks are in free list)
 *  at any time, we could tell if the block is valid, because we may get a pointer of
 *    a block from the adjacent block. 
 * 	
 * 	conclusion:
 * 	  Ideally, for allocated block, we should keep the header information as few as 
 * 	  possible, at least we could get the prev/next adjacent block, and we could tell 
 * 	  if the block is valid or free.
 * 	  from implementation point of view, if we use two pointers to keep prev/next adjacent
 * 	  blocks, we should add another member to suggest if the block is free.
 * 	  If we use a pointer points to prev adjacent block, and record the size of current
 * 	  block, the next adjacent block could be computed from the current address and 
 * 	  the size of the block, then we could compress is_free information into size, of 
 * 	  course, the maximum presented size will decrease.
 * 	  for is_valid, we could put two sentinel in front/back end of the block buffer.
 *
 *    For in_freelist block, we are not care about the header length, if it is not 
 *    toooooooooo long.
